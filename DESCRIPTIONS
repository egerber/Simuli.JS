specify all attributes of a unit by a state object which can be accessed in a generic fashion across all units

every unit only defines behavior for state transitions

How to make generic learning approach that can be easily modified (including parameters)

micro-learning
macro-learning

apply systems thinking

study emergent properties

study the interactions between the components of a dynamic systems

integrative whole

"A complex system is a system composed of many components which may interact with each other"

The framework is inspired by systems thinking and aims at the study of systems (systems theory)

express synergy and  emergent behavior

bioinformatics tries to deliver a comprehensive picture of various biological processes.

It aims to increase understanding for biological processes. It helps the finding of genes in sequences or the clustering, classification and naming of genetic data as well as the prediction of protein strucutres based on genetic data. Bioinformatics performs these tasks by making use of various techniques from pattern recognition, data mining, etc.
