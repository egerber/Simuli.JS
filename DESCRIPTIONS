specify all attributes of a unit by a state object which can be accessed in a generic fashion across all units

every unit only defines behavior for state transitions

How to make generic learning approach that can be easily modified (including parameters)

micro-learning
macro-learning

apply systems thinking

study emergent properties

study the interactions between the components of a dynamic systems

integrative whole

"A complex system is a system composed of many components which may interact with each other"

The framework is inspired by systems thinking and aims at the study of systems (systems theory)

express synergy and  emergent behavior


carefully engineered/designed
