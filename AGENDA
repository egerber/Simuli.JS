Experience with the apprehension of "global" patterns that allow to show good performance for a large variety of inputs without much configuration 
-> when I look at different cellular automata I am able to detect certain patterns (triangles, lines, rectangles, etc.) with very short time of adaptation. This means that I have a farily good set of patterns that are helpful in many scenarios
